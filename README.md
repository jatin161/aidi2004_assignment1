Agenda: -
In this assignment, you will learn how to use the Hugging Face API and Gradio.io to create an interactive
application for natural language processing tasks. You will utilize the power of the Hugging Face Transformers
library and Gradio.ioâ€™s user-friendly interface to build an LLM based application of your choice.



Introduction: -
During this assignment I have study how to build of an interactive image classification application with
Gradio.io and the Transformers library from Hugging Face. This application's goal is to allow users to
categorize images into predefined classes.


Model Used: -
Image Classification | Vision Transformer (base-sized model) | google/vit-base-patch16-224 |
It is a pre-trained Vision Transformer (VIT) model from Hugging Face's Transformers library for image
classification tasks. It learns an internal representation of images which can be used for extracting the
relevant features which will be beneficial for our intended task.
